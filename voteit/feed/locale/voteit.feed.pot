#. Default: When the checkbox below is checked your meeting will be able to show a
#. public RSS feed that can be followed with a RSS reader. This feed will contain
#. info about when changes are made in the meeting and who did the changes. You can
#. access the feed on: 'The meeting URL' + '/feed'. This should be something like
#. 'www.yourdomain.com/yourmeetingname/feed'. If you want the feed to show up in an
#. iframe you can use '/framefeed' instead. This is an advanced feature and read
#. more about it in the manual on wiki.voteit.se. Please note a word of warning:
#. the feed is public for all who can figure it out.
